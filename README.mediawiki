== ABOUT ==

This extension allows your users to login using their email in addition
to account name.

* Author: Vitaliy Filippov, 2013+
* License: GPLv3 or later
* Homepage: http://wiki.4intra.net/LoginByEmail

== USAGE ==

Just install. The extension will modify the standard MediaWiki login form
allowing to use email in the "username:" field.

== INSTALLATION ==

* Apply the patch to MediaWiki code (use .1.21.diff if your mediawiki is an older one):
  cd <YOUR_WIKI_DIRECTORY>
  patch -p1 < extensions/LoginByEmail/LoginByEmail.1.26.diff
* Include extension into your LocalSettings.php - add the line:
  require_once("$IP/extensions/LoginByEmail/LoginByEmail.php");
* Optionally you can allow "wrong password" errors for email login with:
*: <tt>$wgLoginByEmailDiscloseExistence = true;</tt>
*: Please note it's a less secure behaviour because it allows to check if an arbitrary email is registered in your wiki.
